# VBA-Homework-Assignment-2

This is READ ME file, homework 2, VBA.
I have worked as a VB6 developer for a biotech, way back in 2000-2004. I used old prefixes for variables, just seemed logical, but too much typing.
Was fun, this. I made an Excel workbook which iterated through a molecular database (Oracle) and pulled out experimental data, 
jumping all over Excel as it looked to see which col and row to stick the data in. It was quite impressive at the time. :)

I tried to comment extensively in the code to help me think it through, and also to document for you.
